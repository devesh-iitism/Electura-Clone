						<p>There are a lot of services in the market for e-learning but I was looking for something that I can trust on. I contacted Electura for a doubt clearing session and I was amazed at the quality of the teachers they have. They put forward their best foot in order to help me. I am surely going to continue with Electura for my study journey.</p>

						<p>I was worried about my child as he was never able to focus on his studies. I got to know about Electura & looking at the background of their teachers, I booked a counselling session for my kid. It was good to see such dedicated tutors, genuinely thinking about a childâ€™s future. After the session, I am confident enough and ready to enroll my child with them.</p>

						<p>I always strive for creating value in this world. Though having worked in the corporate as well as going through the MBA process after cracking IIT, I was looking for the satisfaction of shaping the future. Electura gave me a platform to give back to the society and help young minds of the world. Happy to be an Electurar.</p>
